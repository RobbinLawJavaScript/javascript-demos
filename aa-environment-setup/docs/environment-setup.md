    "! + enter" will give html5 template.

    Some Emmet concepts that use same syntax as CSS:

        + is the sibling selector ex. nav+ul+li gives them as siblings.
  
        > is the child selector ex. nav>ul>>li*6 gives them as children of the previous.

        ^ is the move up action.

        . class

        # id

    Use "Ctrl + Space" to get Emmet back in play.
