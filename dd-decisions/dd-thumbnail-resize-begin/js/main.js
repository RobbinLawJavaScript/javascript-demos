//When a gallery thumbnail size button is clicked, 
//the corresponding size class
//should be added to the div.thumbnails element.
//This will apply the corresponding CSS rule to  
//modify the display of the thumbnail images.
//In addition to this, the clicked button should be 
//made active (i.e. add the active class).
