- [google developers](https://developers.google.com/)
- [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) - JSHint can be used to 'lint' your code, which basically means that it will help you locate any hard to find errors and style no-nos that you may have in your code.
- [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - jsFiddle allows you to test out your ideas (and share them!) without having to go through the usual process of edit-save-refresh.  Just enter your desired HTML, CSS, and JS and away you go!
